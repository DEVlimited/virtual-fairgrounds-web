# Virtual Fairgrounds - Browser Version

At the heart of the Virtual Fairgrounds project lies a profound commitment to preserving the essence of Oklahoma City's historic Fairgrounds District, an area once teeming with life and culture, now remembered only through scattered narratives and memories. This initiative leverages immersive virtual reality technology platforms designed by Droneâ€™s Eye View (DEV) to resurrect a neighborhood once vibrant with culture and community, but lost to the tides of urban renewal. The project, inspired by the visionary guidance of Librarian Judith Matthews, is not merely a technical feat; it is a heartfelt tribute to an Oklahoma City treasure tragically lost. By weaving archival recordings and oral histories into the fabric of the virtual environment, DEV aims to offer an immersive educational experience that honors the district's legacy. The urgency of this mission is underscored by the dwindling number of individuals who experienced Deep Deuce firsthand, making this project a crucial bridge between past and present generations.
